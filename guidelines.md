## üìù Scene Description Guidelines

RayTracer uses a custom, text-based format to define what will be rendered.

### üî¢ 1. Float Variables

You can define float constants to use later:

```julia
float angle(90)
```

### üé® 2. Materials
Materials define how objects interact with light in the scene. Each material specifies two key properties:

- **Surface behavior** ‚Äî how the material reflects or scatters incoming light.
- **Emittance** ‚Äî how the material emits light (if any).

The general syntax to define a material is:

```julia
material <material_name>(<surface>, <emittance>)
```

Supported properties for both `<surface>` and `<emittance>`:

- **Types**:
    - `diffuse` ‚Äî reflects incoming light uniformly in all directions.
    - `specular` ‚Äî mirror-like reflection.

- **Pigments** (color or texture) used inside each type:
    - `uniform(<r, g, b>)` ‚Äî solid color.
    - `checkered(<color1>, <color2>, squares_per_unit)` ‚Äî checkerboard pattern.
    - `image("path/to/image.pfm")` ‚Äî image-based texture, both HDR (`.pfm`) and LDR (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.tif`) image formats are supported.

#### **Example**:
```julia
material plane_material(
    diffuse(
        checkered(<1.0, 1.0, 0.2>, <0.1, 0.2, 0.5>, 4)
    ),
    uniform(<0, 0, 0>)
)
```

This defines a material named `plane_material` with the following characteristics:


- A **diffuse surface** that uses a checkered pattern made of two colors: `<1.0, 1.0, 0.2>` (britght yellow) and `<0.1, 0.2, 0.5>` (dark blue).

- An **emittance** of `<0, 0, 0>`, which means the material does **not** emit light (black is interpreted as zero light emission).


### üß± 3. Objects

To create an object, define its **shape**, assign a **material**, and place it into the scene using a **transformation**.

Each shape **must** be declared with an **identifier**. This is required because it facilitates constructing more complex shapes using *Constructive Solid Geometry ([CSG](#-4-constructive-solid-geometry-csg))*.  
The general syntax to define a shape is:

```julia
shape <shape_name>(<material>, <transformation>)
```
---

#### **Basic Shapes**
- `sphere` $-$ Unit sphere centered at $(0, 0, 0)$. 
- `plane` $-$ Infinite plane at $z = 0$. 
- `cube` $-$ Cube with $l = 1.0$ centered at $(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)$. 

---

#### **Transformation**
- `identity` ‚Äî No transformation.
- `translation([x, y, z])` ‚Äî Translates the object by the vector $\vec{v} = \left( x, y, z \right)$.
- `scaling(sx, sy, sz)` ‚Äî Scales the object along each axis. All values must be non-zero. Use negative values to apply reflections.
- `rotation_x(deg)` ‚Äî Rotates the object around the **x-axis** by the given angle in degrees.
- `rotation_y(deg)` ‚Äî Rotates the object around the **y-axis** by the given angle in degrees.
- `rotation_z(deg)` ‚Äî Rotates the object around the **z-axis** by the given angle in degrees.

You can **combine transformations** using the `*` operator. Transformations are applied **right to left**.

#### **Example**:
```julia
shape small_sphere(sphere_material, translation([-2.5, -1, 0.2]) * scaling(0.2, 0.2, 0.2))
```
This creates a `sphere` with the material `sphere_material`, a radius of $0.2$, and origin at $(-2.5,\, -1,\, 0.2)$.

---

### üß© 4. Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)

CSG allows the composition of shapes using boolean operations: `union`, `fusion`, `intersection`, and `difference`.  
A `csg` is a shape object, so it must be declared with an identifier. Since it behaves like any other shape, you can build complex objects by nesting multiple CSGs.

- A global transformation can be applied to the entire CSG block, preserving the relative positions of its internal components (if no needed use `identity`).

- Shapes used inside a CSG are not added to the world as standalone objects. They only exist as part of the CSG.  
To use a shape both inside and outside a CSG, you must duplicate it using the `copy` command with a new name.

```julia
copy <new_shape_name>(<original_shape_name>)
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** This is especially useful when working with a complex CSG (e.g., `csg1`) that you want to reuse multiple times inside a larger structure (e.g., `csg_global`).  
Instead of reconstructing `csg1` every time, you can define it once and then duplicate it wherever needed using `copy`, saving time and avoiding repetition.

The general syntax to define a CSG is:

```julia
csg my_csg_shape(<shape_1>, <shape_2>, <operation>, <transformation>)
```
**Operations**
- `Union` $-$ Merges the volumes: both shapes are kept, and all intersections between them are detected and included.
- `Fusion` $-$ Like union, but only the external surfaces are retained, removing internal overlaps.
- `Intersection` $-$ Only the common volume is preserved: intersections are kept only if occur on a part of one shape that lies inside the other.
- `Difference` $-$ Subtracts the second shape from the first: only the parts of the first shape that are **not** inside the second are retained, or intersections from the second shape that occur within the first.

#### **Example**:
```julia
csg partial_csg(sphere_1, cube_2, difference, identity)
csg total_csg(partial_csg, plane_3, fusion, translation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
copy cube_2_copy(cube_2)  # This creates a copy of object cube_2 that will be visible in the scene

```
This sequence builds a CSG object by subtracting `cube_2` from `sphere_1`, then combining the result with `plane_3` using a `fusion` operation. `cube_2_copy` is a duplicate of `cube_2`, placed in the scene independently.

---

### üé• 5. Camera

The `camera` represents the viewpoint that **sees** the scene. It defines where the observer is located and how the scene is projected onto the image plane. The camera‚Äôs position and orientation are set using a **transformation**.

Two types of cameras are available:

- **Perspective Camera** ‚Äî Simulates a realistic camera with perspective projection, where objects farther away appear smaller. It requires specifying the distance from the camera to the image plane (screen).
    ```julia
    camera(perspective, <transformation>, <screen_distance>)
    ```

- **Orthogonal** ‚Äî Uses orthographic projection, which preserves object sizes regardless of depth. This is ideal for technical or architectural visualization where true dimensions are important.
    ```julia
    camera(orthogonal, <transformation>)
    ```

#### **Example**:
```julia
float angle(90)
camera(perspective, rotation_z(angle) * translation([-4, -1, 1]), 1.0)
```
This defines a perspective camera positioned at $(5, -1, 1)$ (starting from $x = -1$ and translating by $-4$) and rotated around the **z-axis** by `angle` degrees, with a screen distance of $1$. The angle variable can also be overridden via the command line:
```shell
julia RayTracer <tracer> --angle <value>
```
If `--angle` is not specified, the value from the scene file ($90$) is used. This setup allows convenient previewing by adjusting the camera rotation without modifying the scene file.


### 6. Working example
*Note* ‚Äî You can write comment using `#`
```bash
# Float variable (can be overridden via CLI: --angle <value>)
float angle(0.0)
