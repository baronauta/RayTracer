A collection of shapes forming a 3D world.

This struct has a field that is a vector of shapes (`shapes::Vector{Shape}`). 
    
It is possible to add shapes (`add!`) 
and check for intersections with a ray (`ray_intersection`).

Construct an empty world with no shapes.

This creates a new `World` with an empty list of shapes, allowing shapes
to be added later using the `add!` function.

Add a shape to the world.

Appends the given `shape` to the `shapes` vector in the `world`.

"""
Find the closest intersection between a ray and the shapes in the world.

Iterates over all shapes in the world, checking for intersections 
with the provided `ray` using the `ray_intersection` method.

Returns the closest intersection (`HitRecord`), if any, or `nothing` if no intersection is found.
