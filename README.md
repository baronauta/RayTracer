**RayTracer** is a text-based ray tracing engine built in Julia, designed to render photorealistic images from user-defined 3D scenes. It supports high-dynamic-range rendering and offers flexible output options, including tone-mapped conversions to common image formats.

### Core Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Ray Tracing Renderer**  
  Renders photorealistic images from 3D scenes using multiple ray tracing algorithms ([Scene Rendering](#scene-rendering)).

- üåà **Tone Mapping**  
  Converts high-dynamic-range `.pfm` images into standard low-dynamic-range formats (e.g. `.png`) for display and sharing ([Tone Mapping](#tone-mapping)).

- üîÅ **Image-to-PFM Converter**  
  Transforms standard LDR images (`.png`, `.jpg`) into HDR `.pfm` format, enabling their use as textures or lighting sources in rendering ([LDR to HDR Conversion](#ldr-to-hdr-conversion)).

## Installation

### Requirements
RayTracer is a Julia-based library that runs on:

- **Julia v1.x** ‚Äì [Install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
- **Supported OS**: Linux or Windows

### Steps

1. Download the [v1.1.0 release](https://github.com/baronauta/RayTracer/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and extract the archive.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted directory.

2. Launch Julia:
    ```bash
    julia
    ```

3. Activate the project and install dependencies:
    ```julia
    using Pkg
    Pkg.activate(".")
    Pkg.instantiate()
    ```

4. *(Optional)* Run tests to verify installation:
    ```julia
    Pkg.test()
    ```


## Usage Instructions
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip:** To see a brief overview of available options and usage info for *any* command or tool, you can use the `-h` flag with that command. For example:  ```julia RayTracer <command> -h``` or ```julia image2pfm -h```

### Scene Rendering

RayTracer uses a simple text-based format for scene description. See [guidelines.md](https://github.com/baronauta/RayTracer/blob/master/guidelines.md) for the details on how to define your own scenes.

To render a scene, run the following command:
```bash
julia RayTracer <tracer> <scenefile> <witdth> <height>
```
where `<scenefile>` is the `.txt` file with the scene to render, `<tracer>` selects the rendering algorithm and and `<width>` and `<height>` specify the image resolution.

Each run produces a **high-dynamic-range (HDR)** image in the `.pfm` format storing detailed lighting and color information, and a quick low-dynamic-range LDR preview (e.g. `.png`) for viewing (basic default tone mapping is used).  
For more control over the LDR output, apply custom tone mapping ‚Äî see the [Tone Mapping](#tone-mapping) section.
### Scene Structure
A typical scene description consists of two main parts:

- **Shapes**  
  The geometric objects that make up the scene ‚Äî such as spheres or planes. 
- **Camera**  
 Defines the viewpoint, orientation, and perspective from which the scene is rendered.

RayTracer simulates a camera by casting rays‚Äîlines representing paths of light‚Äîfrom the camera‚Äôs position through each pixel into the scene. These rays are tested for intersections with the shapes defined in the scene. The rendering algorithm then determines how light interacts at these intersections to compute the final pixel color.


### Available Tracers

- **`pathtracer`**  
  A physically-based renderer that simulates realistic lighting, including global illumination, soft shadows, and reflections.

- **`flattracer`**  
  A fast, non-photorealistic renderer that returns the surface color and emitted light at the ray intersection. It ignores lighting, shadows, and reflections.  
  Useful for quick previews, geometry debugging, and visualizing base materials.

- **`onofftracer`**  
  A minimal tracer that detects ray-object intersections only, without computing lighting or color.
  Returns white for hits and black for misses.  
  Useful for visibility checks and fast silhouette previews.


To display usage instructions and available options for a specific tracer, use the `-h` flag:
```bash
julia RayTracer <tracer> -h
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Rendering your scene when using the `pathtracer`, may take a considerable amount of time due to the complexity of realistic light simulations.


#### Try by yourself
You can reproduce these results by using the input file `examples/demo.txt` and selecting one of the available tracers:

```bash
julia RayTracer <tracer> examples/demo.txt 500 500
```

### Available Cameras
Two types of cameras are available:

- **Perspective Camera** ‚Äî Simulates a realistic camera with perspective projection, where objects farther away appear smaller. 

- **Orthogonal** ‚Äî Uses orthographic projection, which preserves object sizes regardless of depth. This is ideal for technical or architectural visualization where true dimensions are important.

### Tone Mapping

Once you have the `.pfm` file, you can apply **tone mapping**‚Äîthe process of converting HDR images into LDR ones suitable for standard displays.  
Because tone mapping is scene-dependent, we encourage you to experiment with different parameters to achieve optimal visual results.

To perform tone mapping, run the following command
```bash
julia RayTracer tonemapping <input_file>
```
where `<input_file>` is the PFM file you want to convert.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: The LDR formats supported are `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tif`.
---
### LDR to HDR Conversion

RayTracer also supports converting **low-dynamic-range (LDR)** images (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`) into **high-dynamic-range (HDR)** `.pfm` format. This feature is useful for integrating external images or textures into HDR-based rendering.
To perform the conversion, run:

```bash
julia image2pfm <input_image>
```
